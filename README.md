# Welcome to my profile!
People online mostly call me Kos, although my name is Kosain. Take your pick on what you want to call me ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯
## What do I like doing?
I like developing small tools that solve niche annoying problems. Making programs and scripts are very fun too. I like software and hardware development (I play with arduinos a lot), and making music has been a hobby of mine for a long time. I love contributing to all sorts of projects. I have also been learning 3D animation.

## Language preferences
1. C#
2. Python
3. C++ (Arduino)
4. HTML/CSS/JS
5. Scratch (Believe it or not)
